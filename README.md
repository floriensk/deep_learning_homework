# Deep Learning homework of the team Trijó (2022)
## Team
Our team, named *Trijó*, consists of the following members:<br/>
+ Soroncz-Szabó, Flórián (J0QWCB)
+ Schäffer, Tamás (CO2WYC)
+ Frecska, Hajnalka (C1MTMR)

## Aim of the project
The primary objective is to extract a number of facial features from images of faces. For this purpose, we use some databases of facial images available online, along with some pre-trained, online available models to accelerate the learning process

### Objective as a homework
By completing this project we would like to assess how a few different hyperparameter settings and training methods influence the learning curve (time needed and achieved accuracy).
